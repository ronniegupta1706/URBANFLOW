# UrbanFlow: Intelligent Traffic Prediction and Route Optimization  

## Project Overview  
UrbanFlow is a machine learning-based system designed to predict urban traffic congestion and optimize route planning using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) models for time-series forecasting and Graph Neural Networks (GNN) for road network analysis.  

This project leverages data mining techniques to analyze real-time and historical traffic data, providing accurate congestion predictions and suggesting the most efficient routes to improve urban mobility.  

## Features  
- Traffic Congestion Prediction: Uses LSTM to forecast future congestion levels based on historical data.  
- Route Optimization: Implements Dijkstra’s Algorithm and A* Algorithm to find the shortest, least congested path.  
- Real-Time Adaptability: Dynamically updates congestion predictions with new data inputs.  
- Accident Hotspot Detection: Identifies high-risk traffic zones based on congestion trends.  
- Multi-Dataset Learning: Uses Urban Mobility Dataset, Bengaluru Traffic Dataset, and METR-LA Dataset to improve generalization across different cities.  
- Visualization: Generates congestion heatmaps, route suggestions, and traffic analysis reports.
